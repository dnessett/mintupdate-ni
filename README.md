The goal of this project is to create a version of mintupdate (called mintupdate-ni) that has an option of executing without user interaction. This is useful when managing a farm of LM systems. The initial objective is to implement a "no-interactive" option that allows mintupdate-ni to run unattended on the farm systems. The first use of this feature is to employ mintupdate-ni using the Salt distributed managment application. The Salt master will distribute commands that use mintupdate-ni to upgrade the operating system of each farm system (called in Salt a minion) to a specific version. Later versions of mintupdate-ni may use the Python script mintupdate-script.py in other distributed management applications, such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, etc.

The instructions to setup the mintupdate-ni OS update are in the document SETUP located in the doc older associated with the distributed management application, which for Salt is the directory "salt". Once setup, the instructions how to use mintupdate-ni are in the document EXECUTION also located in the doc folder associated with the distributed management application. Both of these documents should be read with care in order to use this application.
